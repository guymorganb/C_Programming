The scanf function requires pointers to the variables where the input should be stored. When you pass a variable to scanf using the & operator (like &age), you're actually passing the address of the variable, not the variable itself. This allows scanf to directly modify the value at that address.

For example, in scanf("%d", &age);, &age is the address of the age variable. scanf reads the input from the user and directly stores it at this address.
