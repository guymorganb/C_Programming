# 📁 Standalone C Project Structure

A typical C project may include directories for source files (`src`), headers (`include`), libraries (`lib`), binaries (`bin`), object files (`obj`), tests (`test`), and documentation (`doc`). Below is a structured representation:

## 🌲 Project Tree

## 🛠️ Building the Project
- Use the `Makefile` to define the build process for compiling source files into executables.
- The `Makefile` typically includes targets for building the `bin` and `obj`, as well as cleaning up build artifacts.

## 📝 Documentation
- Keep your project's `README.md` updated with instructions on how to build and use your project.
- Use the `/doc` directory to store additional documentation like API guides, development notes, or usage manuals.
The /src directory contains all the source .c files, organized by module or functionality. 
Headers that are part of your public API might be in /include to make them easily accessible to other projects or modules. The /lib directory could contain any third-party or external libraries that your project uses. The /bin directory is the typical location for the output executables after compilation, 
and /obj for the intermediary object files. The /test directory contains your unit tests, and /doc is for documentation.


# Notes on Header files:

In C programming, a .h file is a header file. It typically contains function prototypes, which declare the names, return types, and parameters of functions so that other files (source files) can call those functions. Header files can also contain definitions for types, macros, and constants used throughout your program.

Here's an example of what might be in a header file:

```c
// math_operations.h

#ifndef MATH_OPERATIONS_H
#define MATH_OPERATIONS_H

// Function prototype for adding two integers
int add(int x, int y);

// Function prototype for subtracting two integers
int subtract(int x, int y);

// A macro for calculating the square of a number
#define SQUARE(x) ((x) * (x))

// A constant for the value of pi
const double PI = 3.14159;

#endif // MATH_OPERATIONS_H
```
The #ifndef, #define, and #endif preprocessor directives at the top and bottom of the file are called "include guards." They prevent the contents of the header file from being included multiple times in the same file, which can happen when multiple files include the same header, either directly or indirectly. This could lead to errors such as redefinition of functions or variables.

The .h header files are included in .c source files using the #include preprocessor directive. This tells the compiler to replace that line with the entire contents of the specified header file. For example:

```c
// main.c

#include "math_operations.h"

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 3);
    int squared = SQUARE(4);

    return 0;
}
```
The source file main.c includes math_operations.h, so it can use the add function, the SQUARE macro, and the PI constant defined in the header. The implementation (definition) of the functions declared in math_operations.h would be in a corresponding .c file, typically with the same name as the header (e.g., math_operations.c).
